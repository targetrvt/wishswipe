## 🎨 What Technology Is This?

- Used by Twitter, Spotify, Uber, and many major apps
- Same quality as native apps
- Easier to maintain and update
- Works across all devices

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Add to Dock" option not showing:

- **Update macOS**: Requires Monterey 12.3 or later
- **Visit site multiple times**: Safari wants to ensure you use it
- **Try Chrome**: Install prompt appears immediately
- **Clear cache**: Safari → Preferences → Privacy → Manage Website Data

### App not opening after install:

- Check Applications folder: `/Applications/`
- Check Dock: Look for WishSwipe icon
- Try relaunching from Share menu

1. **Right-click** WishSwipe in Dock
2. Select **Options → Remove from Dock**
3. Or drag to Trash from Applications folder
